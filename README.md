The following email from Sue Zachmann, ScriptED's Director of Corporate
Partnerships, describes the scope of the project:

> We could use some coding help in our efforts to analyze the full extent
> of the potential market in NYC for our high school coding classes. We’d
> love to complete the first step of the project no later than early
> January. Step 2 and Step 3 have some additional timing flexibility.
>
> ## STEP 1
> 
> We’ve got a spreadsheet with data relating to some 200 NYC high schools.
> We’d like to automate a function that can return commute time via public
> transportation (or walking if faster) between a few core origin locations
> (say, Grand Central, Fulton Center and MetroTech in Brooklyn) and each of
> the 200 schools. The data is relatively static, so we won’t need to
> interact with this functionality on a day to day basis but will need to
> be able to relatively easily rerun if we add new schools to the
> spreadsheet or potentially add new origin points. 
> 
> ## STEP 2
>
> We’d like to build an interactive map that has a pin for each school
> showing the commute data from above, as well as some of the additional
> information from the schools spreadsheet (number of students, grades
> served, other STEM programs at the school etc.)
>
> ## STEP 3
>
> We’d like to overlay on the schools map some more pins reflecting high
> level data (which also lives in a spreadsheet) about some of the
> city’s bigger employers so that we can analyze if there are schools
> that are difficult to reach from the core locations but that still
> might be serviceable if we fostered a relationship with a nearby employer.
